# AI-Virtual-Hardware
The computer is one of the wonderful and fascinating inventions of technology and has come to significant use to humans in every sector. The existing computer technology is already advanced and modern. Even so, this proposed system will provide better ease of technology to humans. The proposed system is an AI application with three combined features that are AI Virtual Mouse,  Keyboard and Painter These three features (AI Virtual Mouse,  Keyboard and Painter) use a common hand tracking module. Hand tracking module is a python file which has a class name Hand Detector and it contains 4 member functions that are findDistance, findHands, findPosition and fingerUp. Using this module the three features work successfully. The proposed system opens with a main window which is a GUI screen made with the help of module Tkinter. This main GUI page contains all the three features (AI Virtual Mouse,  Keyboard and Painter) combined. The common libraries used for system execution are OpenCV, CVZone, numpy, autopy, mediapipe, etc.
